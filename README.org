* Inkscape Zen Mode Setup Guide
This guide explains how to configure a minimalist Inkscape profile with a white background, no startup docks, and a compact UI that respects tiling window managers (like niri).

** Create a Dedicated "Zen" Profile
Isolate your Zen settings from your regular Inkscape configuration using environment variables.

Bash
#+begin_src sh
cp -r ~/.config/inkscape ~/.config/inkscape-zen
#+end_src
From now on, launch your Zen version using:

#+begin_src sh
INKSCAPE_PROFILE_DIR=~/.config/inkscape-zen inkscape
#+end_src
** Create your template
Launch your Zen profile.

Press Shift + Ctrl + D to open Document Properties.

Under the Display tab, click the color boxes for Page and Desk and set them to pure white (FFFFFFFF).

Go to File > Save Template...
** Prevent Docks from Opening at Startup
Inkscape remembers open dialog tabs (like Objects;FillStroke;) and forces them open on launch. We will prevent that :

Close Inkscape.

Open ~/.config/inkscape-zen/dialogs-state-ex.ini.
Save and close the file.
** Lock In the "Zen" Geometry
Prevent Inkscape from opening with random panel sizes or the wrong window dimensions.

Open Inkscape and go to Edit > Preferences > Interface > Windows.

Select Remember and use last window's geometry.

Close the preferences window.

Set up your ideal canvas: Press F11 (fullscreen), Shift + F11 (hide UI), and F12 (hide dialogs).

Open Preferences one last time, change the setting to Don't save window geometry, and immediately close Inkscape.
